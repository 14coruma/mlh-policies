0. **Show a video explaining hackathons and MLH or ask an MLH representative to speak at the event’s opening ceremony.**  MLH Member Events recognize that many attendees have never been to a hackathon before attending their event and many attendees won’t know what MLH is or what being an MLH Member hackathon means. MLH Member Events show a video or have an MLH rep speak to explain these things.
0. **Distribute MLH sponsor promos and prizes to attendees and provide Space for MLH Sponsors in the EU.** MLH Member Events recognize that MLH’s season sponsors enable the league to exist.

0. **Grant MLH an indefinite license to use event name, branding, and materials to market the event and the league.** MLH puts the event on the official season schedule and promotes it to the MLH Community, but needs your permission to do that.

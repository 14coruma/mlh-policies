# Event Sanctioning Guide

This document outlines the Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathon sanctioning policies. Meeting all of these requirements does not necessarily guarantee sanctioning status for the hackathon.

MLH provides all sanctioned events with the following world-class services to ease the lives of organizers and improve the hacker experience. A full list of official perks for sanctioned events will always be available on the official MLH Website.

Sanctioning requirements are how MLH maintains high quality standards for all events in the season. Hackers have very high expectations for MLH sanctioned events. The current sanctioned hackathon requirements and policies are as follows:

## General Requirements

0. Hackathon organizers must apply to MLH for sanctioning at least thirty (30) days prior to their hackathon. Sanctioned events are the only way hackers can improve their ratings and their school’s ratings, so hackathons must be advertised well enough in advance for hackers in the area to learn about them.
0. To be sanctioned, events must have a confirmed date and location.
0. Events may not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, economic status, veteran status, disability, or age.
0. Sanctioned hackathons must adopt, make available, and enforce the MLH Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone at the event. A link to the Code of Conduct must be placed on the website. All registrants must be agree to the Code of Conduct during registration (e.g. a compulsory check box). The Code of Conduct extends to all attendees, including, but not limited to, hackers, volunteers, organizers, sponsors, judges, and mentors. Additionally, a clear and widely known reporting system must be available for incident reporting.
0. MLH reserves the right to refuse admittance to any individual at a sanctioned event. Reasons may include, but are not limited to, violations of the Code of Conduct, breaking the rules of events, or a pattern of negative contributions to events or community.
0. Organizers grant Major League Hacking a non-exclusive indefinite license to use event name, branding, and materials to market the event and the league. Additionally, Major League Hacking grants organizers a non-exclusive license to use the Major League Hacking name and brand in conjunction with the event.  Major League Hacking reserves the right to terminate the organizer's license at any time in its absolute discretion.
0. Organizers must include the official MLH Season Branding on their website in accordance with the MLH Brand Guidelines.
0. Organizers will notify MLH of any important information or event changes as soon as they occur or before if possible. Often, MLH is able to assist when problems arise, but must receive sufficient notice for this to occur. Additionally, a regular check-in time will be established upon sanctioning. Organizers are required to attend the meeting.
0. Sanctioned events must target a minimum of 80 registrants from at least 3 different universities.
0. Sanctioned events must be predominantly run by students or school faculty.
0. Sanctioned hackathons may not have entry fees.
0. Sanctioned events must be overnight.
0. Sanctioned events must have enough food on site to reasonably feed attendees during the event.
0. Sanctioned events must represent and warrant participants own any intellectual property produced at the event and state this on the website.
0. Sanctioned events must respect and enforce the alcohol laws and customs of the local country and must only allow for moderate alcohol consumption in locales where drinking is allowed.
0. All sanctioned hackathons must make a good-will effort to advertise and make the application for admission publicly available. Secret or invite-only hackathons without a straightforward and publicly known general application process are not eligible. Additionally, organizers must publish the criteria for admission to the event.
0. Only hackers who are students at the time of the hackathon or who have left school within the current school year may compete in Major League Hacking sanctioned events.
0. No hackathon organizer may compete in an event he or she is organizing. This rule extends to judges, sponsors, and other staff.
0. Potential violations of the rules set forth by Major League Hacking, including, but not limited to, the Sanctioning Guide and MLH Code of Conduct or the rules of an officially sanctioned event should be reported immediately to the appointed MLH representative on site or by phone to +1 (409) 202-6060 in North America or +44 80 0808 5675 in Europe, if one is not available. No corrective action may be taken without explicit approval from MLH.

## Day of Event Requirements
0. Organizers must check in all attendees as they arrive at the event. Checking in attendees helps events run more smoothly and provides valuable opportunity to distribute information, swag, and event materials as well as ensure safety by knowing who is in attendance.
0. Organizers must reserve an adequate amount of space for MLH at the event. Common uses of the space include the hardware lab, gaming lounge, photobooth, national sponsor placement, and mini-events. Simply put, this space allows MLH to make the hacker experience even more awesome.
0. MLH sustains itself through sponsorships that add value to sanctioned events and bring value to hackers. For this reason, MLH must be allowed to showcase and/or bring its national sponsors to the event. MLH will inform you if any national sponsors are attending at least two (2) weeks prior to the event.
0. MLH has the right to distribute swag, promotional materials, and prizes to event attendees.
0. Organizers must have a first aid kit on site during the event.
0. There must be at least one organizer on site at any time during the event.
0. All sanctioned events must make a volunteer available to work with MLH throughout the entire weekend.
0. MLH must be able to post signage across the event.
0. MLH must be given time to speak at the event’s opening ceremony.
0. MLH has permission to record and publish photos and video of the event and reserves the exclusive right to produce commercial video content (this does not include TV news or sponsor/event recaps). MLH will work with organizers to ensure compliance with appropriate university or venue video and photo policies.

## Deliverable Requirements

0. All hackathon organizers must sign the appropriate MLH Sanctioning Application and Code of Conduct, which states that they have read and will abide by the most current official sanctioning and ranking policies.
0. Either once attendee registration has been finalized or twenty-four (24) hours prior to the event (which ever occurs first), the hackathon must submit registration data to MLH. MLH uses this data to compile statistics, communicate important information to attendees, and ensure bad actors do not attend events. The minimum required information is name, email, mobile phone number, and school.  Collecting information about gender identity, year in school, major, birthday, food allergies, and special needs is optional, but recommended.
0. Within fourteen (14) days after a sanctioned hackathon concludes, organizers must compile and submit hack submission data (from HackerLeague or ChallengePost) for season rankings and attendee information from check-in and registration.

## Violation of Policies

In the event of a violation of sanctioning guidelines, Code of Conduct, or other official Major League Hacking regulation or policy, actions will be taken to rectify the issue. These actions will typically include, in order of severity, the following:

- Written Warning outlining the violation and how organizers can take action to resolve the issue.
- Temporary Suspension from the current or future MLH season(s).
- Permanent Ban from all MLH activities and future sanctioning.

MLH believes in transparency. In the cases of suspensions or bans, a public statement will be made about what occurred to disqualify the given event.

Major League Hacking reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact MLH by e-mail at hi@mlh.io.

# Membership Guidelines

This document outlines the Major League Hacking (MLH) Membership Guidelines. MLH provides all MLH Member Events with the following benefits and resources (upon availability) to ease the lives of organizers and improve the hacker experience.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Application Date.** To ensure that we have the time and resources to
    successfully support your hackathon, the event must start at
    least three (3) months in the future from the day that you submit
    your application.
    
2.  **Event Date.** Your hackathon must take place during the current or
    upcoming academic year (August - June).
    
3.  **Free to attend.** Member Events do not have entry fees, which makes
    them open and accessible to all participants, regardless of their
    financial situations.
    
4.  **Primarily Students.** At least 80% of your hackathon’s attendees must
    be students at the time of the hackathon or have left school within
    the current academic year.
    
5.  **Level of Study.** Student attendees can be enrolled at any level of
    study at a traditional (middle school, high school, university,
    etc.) or nontraditional (code bootcamp, homeschool, online, etc.)
    institution.
    
6.  **Location.** While there are hackers everywhere, we are only able to
    currently support Member Events located in the following regions:

     -   **North America:** United States, Canada, and Mexico.
     -   **Europe:** The United Kingdom, the European Union, and select other
    European countries.

7.  **Attendance.** To ensure that our resources reach as many hackers as
    possible, we require Member Events to have a minimum number of
    attendees. To qualify to be a Member Event, you must be planning to
    have at least:

     -   **United States:** 200+ attendees        
     -   **Other Countries:** 100+ attendees

8.  **Language.** While hackers speak many languages, we are only able to
    work with events that have an English-language website and make
    announcements during the event in English. If you live in a country
    where English is not the native language, we encourage you to make
    announcements and provide information in both languages.
    
9.  **Duration.** Member Events are 24 to 48 hours long and take place over
    a weekend (usually Friday to Sunday).
    
10. **Overnight Accomodations.** Since many hackers travel long distances to
    attend hackathons, we require Member Events to leave their venues
    open overnight or provide alternate overnight accommodations for
    attendees.

## Benefits

We provide all Member Events with the following complementary benefits
and resources to ease the lives of organizers and improve the hacker
experience. We do not charge organizers or hackers a fee for these
benefits.

### Before your hackathon:

1.  **Season Schedule Listing.** We’ll list your event on the official MLH
    Season schedule. Hundreds of thousands of hackers and sponsors visit
    this page every single year and use it to discover the events they
    want to participate in.
    
2.  **Social media & email promotion.** We’ll promote your event to hundreds
    of thousands of hackers and sponsors via social media and/or the MLH
    monthly newsletter.
    
3.  **Dedicated Support & Mentorship.** Our team of Community Managers
    supports hundreds of Member Events every year. We've helped
    organizers like you handle all sorts of problems and questions. You
    may participate in office hours and tap into the team's expert
    advice and mentorship when you need it in a 1-on-1 environment.
    
4.  **Preferred Vendors & Discounts.** Organizing a great hackathon can be
    expensive. To help you save time and money, we have vetted and
    partnered with amazing vendors that are offering exclusive discounts
    and priority access to Member Events. Whether it's catering from
    Potbelly, stickers from Sticker Mule, or swag from Brand Makers,
    we've got you covered!
    
5.  **(First Time Member Events Only) GitHub Grants.** All first time
    hackathons that become Member Events are eligible for a one-time
    \$1,000 sponsorship and one sponsored ticket to MLH Hackcon, subject
    to approval from GitHub. Information will be sent out 40 days prior
    to your hackathon.
    
6.  **MLH Localhost Workshops.** Hackers want workshops. We’ve created a
    program called MLH Localhost to help you run high-quality workshops
    that get hackers excited either before the hackathon or teach your
    hackers something new during the event. All you need to do is find a
    volunteer to facilitate the workshop. We’ll take care of training
    them on the content and shipping supplies.

### During your hackathon:

1.  **On-site Support.** Think of your MLH representatives as an extension
    of your organizing team. They have a lot of expertise and experience
    with organizing hackathons and are there to help make sure your
    event runs smoothly. They’re able to help you with anything you
    need, from making sure the event runs on-time to mentoring hackers
    to coordinating judging alongside you to even taking out the
    trash. They also have extensive experience resolving conflicts with
    hackers, sponsors, or even organizing teams.
    
2.  **MLH Emergency Budget.** On average, hackathons see a 30-50% attrition
    rate between their signups during registration and the actual day-of
    check-ins. As a result, we encourage organizers to overbook for the
    hackathon up to 200% of your target attendee rate in order to hit
    your actual check-in numbers. If you overshoot your predetermined
    attendance target by overbooking up to 200%, we'll cover the
    difference in food costs to make sure your event doesn't go over
    budget. 
    
3.  **Software Lab.** Every hacker who participates in an Member Event gets
    a bundle of promotional codes and discounts for services from the
    MLH Software Lab. This includes everything from web hosting credit
    to free domain names and beyond.
    
4.  **Hardware Lab.** The MLH Hardware lab contains the latest and greatest
    hardware for hackers to loan out for free at all Member Events. We
    also built software and a process for events to keep track of which
    attendees have which devices. We are able to add non-MLH Hardware
    into our checkout system as requested.
    
5.  **MyMLH Support.** Member Events who
    utilize [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/) for
    registration will receive priority support for setup and
    troubleshooting from our engineering team. MyMLH is an OAuth API
    that makes registering for hackathons a breeze for hackers by
    storing their information and allowing them to easily share it with
    multiple events.
    
6.  **Mini-Events.** Our MLH representative on-site will run a 30-45 minute
    mini-event during your hackathon (before 9pm) to provide a fun break
    from hacking and create a bonding experience for your attendees.
    Mini-Events include [Cup Stacking](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Cup-Stacking.html),
    [!Light](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/no-light/),
    [Slideshare Karaoke](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/slideshow-karaoke/), and
    [Werewolf](http://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/).
    
7.  **Season and Sponsor Swag.** Your event will receive assorted swag
    including Season shirts, Season stickers, event specific "I Demoed"
    stickers, MLH Stickers, GitHub stickers, and feminine hygiene
    products. Events may also receive assorted swag from MLH Season
    sponsors such as pens and t-shirts.
    
8.  **Judging Coordination.** We know that judging is one of the most
    stressful periods during a hackathon. Our MLH representative on-site
    can assist you with running demos and judging during your event in a
    fair, standardized way. You are still expected to recruit and
    coordinate the arrival of judges prior to the event.
    
9.  **Prizes.** All Member Events are provided with special prizes to hand
    out to hackers such as medals for winners and MLH category prizes
    (such as "Best Domain.com Domain Name" or "Best Use of Amazon Web
    Services (AWS)"). We will confirm these prizes with events
    beforehand.

### After your hackathon:

1.  **Surveys.** Anyone who participates in your Member Event will receive a
    post event survey about their experience. We’ll share this data with
    you, show you how you compare to other Member Events, and identify
    some areas of improvement for your next event.
    
2.  **Scoring.** Hackers who participate in Member Events are earning points
    for their school in the MLH Season rankings. At the end of every
    Season, hackers can see how their schools performed against other
    schools and potentially win the MLH Season trophy to take back to
    their hacker club. 

## Requirements

MLH was built by passionate community members. To ensure that Member
Events are as high quality as the hackathons we fell in love with,
organizers are expected to meet the following requirements:

### Onboarding:

1.  **Read and sign the Member Event agreement.** All Member Event lead
    organizers are expected to read and sign the following documents to
    ensure that everyone is on the same page:

     1.  **Member Event Requirements & Benefits** - This document outlines the
         things that we need you to do before, during, and after your
         hackathon and the things we’re doing for you as well.
         
     2.  **Community Values** - This document presents a set of principles shared
         by every Member Event that serve as examples of excellence to your
         attendees and sponsors, as well as other hackathons and communities.
        
     3.  **Code of Conduct** - This document contains the guidelines for expected
         behavior of all attendees (including sponsors, organizers, judges,
         etc.) at MLH events. Having a single code of conduct that is used
         by every hackathon helps us ensure that MLH events are safe and
         inclusive spaces for everyone and that expectations for behavior and
         incident response remain consistent for people who attend multiple
         MLH events. As an organizer of a Member Event, you are expected to
         follow and enforce the MLH Code of Conduct.

2.  **MLH Website Branding.** On your hackathon’s website, you must display
    the MLH Season Trust Badge in the header and the MLH logo under your
    partners section. Hackers and sponsors see the presence of these
    logos and know that you have achieved the level of quality
    guaranteed by being a Member Event.  You can find these assets on
    our official [Brand Guidelines](https://mlh.io/brand-guidelines).
    
3.  **Registration Form.** We require Member Events to update their
    registration form to include a set of basic fields and checkboxes.
    This ensures that we know who is attending Member Events and that
    attendees know what they are agreeing to. We do not collect,
    utilize, or share any personal information without an attendee
    opt-in.

      1.  **Contact / Demographic Info.** Make sure your registration form asks
          for (at least): _first name, last name, email, school, phone number,
          age, gender, race/ethnicity, major, current level of study, and
          expected graduation year._
           
      2.  **Code of Conduct Checkbox.** Add a checkbox with the following language
          about the code of conduct: _"I have read and agree to the [MLH Code of
          Conduct](http://mlh.io/code-of-conduct)."_
          
      3.  **Data Sharing Checkbox.** Add a checkbox with the following language
          about your affiliation with MLH: _"I authorize you to share my
          application/registration information for event administration,
          ranking, MLH administration, pre- and post-event informational
          e-mails, and occasional messages about hackathons in-line with the
          [MLH Privacy Policy](https://mlh.io/privacy). I further I agree to the terms of both the 
          [MLH Contest Terms and Conditions](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/tree/master/prize-terms-and-conditions) 
          and the [MLH Privacy Policy](https://mlh.io/privacy)."_

4.  **Brand License.** We will include your event on the official
    Season schedule and promote it to our community, but we need your
    permission to do so. Grant MLH an indefinite license to use your
    event name, branding, and materials to market your event and the
    Season of Member Events. Additionally, we grant Member Events a
    non-exclusive license to use the MLH name and brand in conjunction
    with the event. MLH reserves the right to terminate the organizer's
    license at any time at our absolute discretion.
    
5.  **Content Agreement.** We love posting photos and videos of Member
    Events on our website and social media, but we can’t do that without
    your permission. Grant MLH permission to record and publish photos
    and video of the event and the exclusive right to produce commercial
    video content (this does not include TV news or sponsor/event
    recaps).
    
6.  **Property Care Agreement.** Member Events recognize that any MLH
    property they borrow (hardware, signage, mini-event supplies, etc.)
    will be used by other Member Events during the year. If any supplies
    are lost, damaged, or late, other events will be unable to utilize
    them. You agree to see that, to the best of your ability, all MLH
    property is cared for and returned on time by your hackers,
    organizers, sponsors, and volunteers.

### Before your hackathon:

1.  **Pre-Event Data.** In order to send our staff and resources to your
    hackathon, we need you to submit the following information at least
    three (3) months before the event:

      1.  Event start and end times
      2.  Venue Address
      3.  Package Shipping Address
      4.  Loading Dock Address & Hours

2.  **Pre-Event Call.** Attend a call with your MLH Community Manager about
    three (3) weeks before the event. We’ll use this time to review your
    final schedule, preview plans for demos and judging, and work
    through any other issues you are facing. We will also let you know
    who your MLH representative on site will be and what shipments
    and packages to expect from us.
    
3.  **Prize List.** Update your list of prizes to include any MLH categories
    (full list provided by your MLH Community Manager) and add "MLH
    Finalist Medals" to the list of prizes that your top team’s receive.
    We partner with both Devpost and Hacker Earth to make this easier.
    As a result, by becoming a Member Event, your hackathon page may
    automatically include MLH branding, prizes, and/or allow us direct
    access.
    
4.  **Registration Data.** Submit all registration data to your MLH
    Community Manager no later than one (1) week prior your event’s
    start date. We use this data to 1) ensure that no repeat violators
    of the Code of Conduct are attending the event and 2) to send
    attendees a pre-event email with info about the resources MLH is
    bringing to the event for them to use. If there are Code of Conduct
    issues with any attendees prior to the event, we will contact you
    for resolution.

### During your hackathon:

1.  **Opening Ceremony.** Reserve 5 - 10 minutes for your MLH representative
    to speak (with slides) during opening ceremony. During this time,
    your MLH representative will help get the audience excited and
    share the resources we brought for them to use during the hackathon.
    
2.  **Closing Ceremony.** Reserve 5 - 10 minutes during your closing
    ceremony for your MLH representative to make a few remarks on behalf
    of MLH and award prizes to the teams that won any MLH category
    prizes. As the overall winners of the event are announced, your MLH
    representative will help you distribute finalist medals to each of
    the teams and take photos of each winning team.
    
3.  **MLH Table.** Reserve a table (4x6 feet or 1.2x1.8 meters minimum) in a
    central place for your MLH representative to engage with attendees
    and distribute swag/credits (stickers, website domains, hosting
    credit, t-shirts, etc). Your attendees will have the best possible
    experience getting support from our staff if this table is as
    accessible as possible, ideally in the main hacking room or close
    nearby. 
    
4.  **Signage.** Display MLH Season and directional signage in key areas
    during the event. Much like displaying the Trust Badge on your
    website, having MLH signage on-site during the event signals your
    commitment to hosting a high quality event and makes your attendees
    feel like they are part of a larger movement.
    
5.  **Checkin.** Allow your MLH representative to distribute MLH swag and
    promotional items at the attendee checkin area. Hackers love to
    receive swag and goodies. Distributing these at checkin creates a
    great first impression and ensures that everyone gets some.
    
6.  **Hardware Lab.** Reserve a table (4x6 feet or 1.2x1.8 meters minimum)
    in a central place for the MLH Hardware Lab to operate. You will
    be expected to find and assign volunteers by time-shifts to manage
    the MLH Hardware Lab for the full duration of the event. By
    providing volunteers, our MLH rep will be freed up to help your
    organizing team and hackers with higher priority event support.
    
7.  **Mini-Event.** Reserve a 1-hour block in your schedule (before 10pm)
    for your MLH representative to run a fun mini-event for attendees.
    Mini-events are a great way for participants to take a break and
    network with each other.
    
8.  **(EUROPE ONLY) On-Site Season Sponsors.** Our amazing sponsors make it
    possible for us to support hackathons all over Europe. Hackers love
    meeting them and they send some of their best mentors to your
    events. If one of our sponsors expresses interest in attending your
    event, we ask that the following be provided (subject to change):

      1.  Reserve a dedicated table where the sponsor can distribute goodies
          and interact with hackers.
          
      2.  Add the sponsor’s logo to your website under the "Sponsors" section.
      
      3.  Reserve a time during your opening ceremony for the sponsor to
          provide an API demo.
          
      4.  Schedule time for your MLH representative to run a fun mini-event on
          behalf of the sponsor (in addition to the MLH mini-event).
          
      5.  List any prizes the sponsor is offering on your prizes page and
          reserve time for the sponsor to award the prize during the closing
          ceremony.

### After your hackathon:

1.  **Checkin & Submission Data.** Submit all checkin and submissions data
    to your MLH Community Manager no later than one week after your
    event. We use this data to calculate Season rankings and to send
    attendees two emails: (1) a post event survey to collect their
    feedback and (2) an email asking them to opt-in to the MLH
    newsletter for future info about hackathons and the League.
    
2.  **Post-Event Call.** Attend a call with your assigned MLH Community
    Manager about three weeks after the event. We’ll use this time to
    run a short retrospective on working together, provide feedback, and
    start planning for future events!
